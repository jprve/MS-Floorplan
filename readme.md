#### Supplementary Files for Thesis in Masters of Machine Learning and AI
By Jamie Paul Parkinson

In this repository is the 3 Jupyter Notebook files for the models created throughout the project, of which are named as follows:
1. [MS_GAN.ipynb](https://github.com/jprve/MS-Floorplan/blob/main/MS_GAN.ipynb) - General Adversarial Network Solution
2. [MS_ProgressiveGAN.ipynb](https://github.com/jprve/MS-Floorplan/blob/main/MS_ProgressiveGAN.ipynb) - Progressive General Adversarial Network Solution
3. [MS_StableDiffusion.ipynb](https://github.com/jprve/MS-Floorplan/blob/main/MS_StableDiffusion.ipynb) - Stable Diffusion Solution

The dataset used for the experiments can be found on HuggingFace: [FloorPlansV2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jprve/FloorPlansV2)
- The Model produced with Stable Diffusion method can be downloaded from HuggingFace: [StableDiff-Vanilla-V2](https://huggingface.co/jprve/StableDiff-Vanilla-V2)
- The Discriminator produce with the Progressive GAN can be downloaded from HuggingFace: [PGAN-Vanilla](https://huggingface.co/jprve/PGAN-Vanilla)
